<h1>Initializing 2D Arrays</h1>
<p>
    Like their one-dimensional counterparts, two-dimensional arrays can be initialized to default values or, if
    values are known in advance, an array initializer can be written into the source code.
</p>
<h2>Initializing 2D Arrays To Default Values</h2>
<p>In the two-parameter constructor shown at left, we see an array initialized to the given dimensions.  The
    contents of the created array remain at the default for the array's element type -- for integers, 0.
</p>
<h2>Initializing 2D Arrays Using an Array Initializer</h2>
<p>In the no-argument constructor shown at left, an array initializer sets the values of the array to predetermined values.
    The dimensions of the array are inferred directly from the initializer.  Here, the resulting array will
    hold three rows, each containing 4 columns.
</p>
<h2>Expressions Involving 2D Arrays</h2>
<p>Assume <code>nums</code> has been initialized using one of the two constructors.
</p><ul>
    <li> nums refers to the entire 2D array, itself</li>
    <li> nums.length refers to the length of the outer array (number of rows)</li>
    <li> nums[0].length refers to the length of an inner array (number of columns for row 0)</li>
    <li> nums[i] refers to the i-th row in the array</li>
    <li> there is no mechanism for referring to the i-th column in the array</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jagged/Ragged Arrays</h2>
<p>It is possible to create an array of arrays where each row has a different number
of columns.  The resulting array is referred to as a "jagged" or "ragged" array.  More information can be
found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20ragged,edges%20when%20visualized%20as%20output"> this Wikipedia article </a>

<h2>Finishing This Task</h2>
<p>Drop a breakpoint into the main method and observe the structures produced during execution.</p>
