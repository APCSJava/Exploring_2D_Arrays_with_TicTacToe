<h1>Dimensioning Arrays</h1>
<p>
    Write code for the constructor such that each of the four fields is initialized as described.
</p>
<p>
    The four fields rely on the constructor parameters as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>the field <code>wide</code> uses the smaller value as the number of rows and the larger value as the number of columns</li>
    <li>the field <code>tall</code> uses the larger value as the number of rows and the smaller value as the number of columns</li>
    <li>the field <code>large</code> uses the larger value as the number of both rows and columns</li>
    <li>the field <code>small</code> uses the smaller value as the number of both rows and columns</li>
</ul>
<div class="hint">
  Determine which of the two parameters, a or b, is smaller and which is larger.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    An array can be initialized as follows: <code>new type[numRows][numColumns];</code>
</div>
<div class="hint">
    The element type is different for each of the fields -- three hold arrays of arrays of primitives while one holds an array of arrays of reference type String.
</div>
