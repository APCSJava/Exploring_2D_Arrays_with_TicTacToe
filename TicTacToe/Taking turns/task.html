<h2>Playing an honest, legal game</h2>
<p>As a first approximation to a fully playable game, assume that play begins with player
  1 and then alternates with player 2 until either one of the players has won the game or
  until the board is full.</p>
<p>In this version, assume that each player will provide only valid, legal moves as input.</p>
<div class="hint">
  You should not have to change anything in the TicTacToe class.  All work should be
done in the Runner class.
