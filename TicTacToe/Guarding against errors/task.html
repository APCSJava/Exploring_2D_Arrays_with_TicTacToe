Previously, we assumed that the player would submit only legal moves -- what should happen
    if the player enters an illegal move?</p>
<h2>Updating the game loop</h2>
<p>Once you have collected the row and column from a player's input, check to see if
the row and column provided constitute a legal move.  If so, handle as you did before.  If not,
print an error message and request fresh input.  Continue this process until a legal move
is provided.</p>
<p>You do not need to worry about the player entering gibberish (ie. "Xy47zQ 5R").  Assume they
    continue to enter two integers but do check these integers to verify that the row and column
are on the board and the space is unclaimed.</p>
<div class="hint">
  You previously implemented a method to check against illegal moves.  Use it.

<h2>Sample game illustrating how to handle illegal moves</h2>
<blockquote>
    [0, 0, 0]<br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br><br>
    Player 1: Enter the row and column for your move:<br><br>
    > 1 1<br><br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br>
    [0, 1, 0]<br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br><br>
    Player 2: Enter the row and column for your move:<br><br>
    > 1 1<br><br>
    Illegal move.  Please try again:<br><br>
    > -1 0<br><br>
    Illegal move.  Please try again:<br><br>
    > 1 0<br><br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br>
    [2, 1, 0]<br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br><br>
    Player 1: Enter the row and column for your move:<br><br>
    > 1 1<br><br>
    Illegal move.  Please try again:<br><br>
    > 0 0<br><br>
    [1, 0, 0]<br>
    [2, 1, 0]<br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br><br>
    Player 2: Enter the row and column for your move:<br><br>
    > 1 2<br><br>
    [1, 0, 0]<br>
    [2, 1, 2]<br>
    [0, 0, 0]<br><br>
    Player 1: Enter the row and column for your move:<br><br>
    > 2 2<br><br>
    [1, 0, 0]<br>
    [2, 1, 2]<br>
    [0, 0, 1]<br><br>
    Player 1 wins!<br>
