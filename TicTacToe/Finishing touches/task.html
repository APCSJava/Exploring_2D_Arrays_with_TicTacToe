<p>The basic functionality of the game has been established.  </p>
<p>What follow are some challenges you can undertake on your own to make
the game better.</p>
<h2>Offering repeat plays</h2>
<p>Currently, the game plays only a single round and then exits.  To keep players
    from having to restart the program, ask the player, "Would you like to play again?"
    after the conclusion of each round.  If the player
responds "Y" or -1 or some signal value of your choosing, play the game again.  Continue until
the player responds "N" or 0 or some other signal value.</p>
<p>You can also keep monitor and alternate initial players each round.</p>
<h2>Keeping score</h2>
<p>If offering to let the game play over and over, keep track of how many times
each player has won.  Update and display these totals at the conclusion of each round
    and at the conclusion of the game.</p>
<h2>Shaking up the strings</h2>
<p>Perhaps you would prefer to see 'X' and 'O' rather than 1 and 0.  If so, consider
how you might change the display of the board.  See if you can accomplish this
    <b><i>without</i></b> modifying the TicTacToe class.</p>
<div class="hint">
  The String class has a method, replace, that can substitute one character for
another.  Use this method to modify the string received from the game before
displaying to the players.
</div>
<div class="hint">
  A second way to display the grid differently would be to get the game board using
its public getter method rather than relying on the result of <code>game.toString()</code>.
    Then, build the string in the Runner class, perhaps in a private, static helper method.
</div>
<h2>Adding your own flair</h2>
<p>Make any additions to the game that you wish.  Modify the prompts, edit the
response strings, etc.  Have fun!</p>
<p>There is no automated test for this task, so once you are satisfied with your work,
you are done!</p>
