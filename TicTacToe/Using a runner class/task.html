<p>A runner class is useful for interacting with the user.</p>
<p>Inside the body of the main method, create an instance of your
    TicTacToe class and print it. You should see the default board printed
    to standard output.</p>
<div class="hint">
    In this exercise, the expected output of your print statement ends with one
    newline character. If you returned a newline character from the toString
    method of your TicTacToe class, then you may have too many. If it appears
    you are printing the correct output,
    consider whether you need to add (or remove) a new line character.
