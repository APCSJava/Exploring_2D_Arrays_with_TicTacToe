    Implement the toString method to generate a descriptive string suitable for printing to the console.
</p>
<p>The desired string should have three lines, one for each row of the board.  Shown
    together, the three rows of output should look like the following:</p>
<p>
    <code>
        [0, 0, 0]<br>
        [0, 0, 0]<br>
        [0, 0, 0]
    </code>
</p>
<p>Tip:
    The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#toString(int[])">java.util.Arrays</a>
    class provides a toString method which accepts an array as a parameter and produces the needed string for each row.
    Follow the link to learn more and then use it in your solution.</p>
<p>
    CAUTION! Do not print to the console. Instead, build and return
    a string that <i>when printed</i> (by other code) would produce the output shown.
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Use the toString method of the java.util.Arrays class to print each row in the array.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    After each row, include a newline character (\n) to start a fresh line at that point
    in the string.  The newline character sequence is, itself, a string, so it must be placed
    within quotes in your source code.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    There are newline characters following the 1st and 2nd row but no newline character following the third row.
