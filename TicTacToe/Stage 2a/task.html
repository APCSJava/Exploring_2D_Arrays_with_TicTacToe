<h1>Prepare for Printing</h1>
<p>
Override the toString method to generate a string suitable for printing to the console.
</p>
<p>The desired output looks like the following:</p>
<p>
    <code>
        [0, 0, 0]<br>
        [0, 0, 0]<br>
        [0, 0, 0]
    </code>
</p>
<p>Each row of the array can be rendered as a string using the toString method provided by
the <code>java.util.Arrays</code> class.</p><p>
    Remember not to print to the console inside toString.  Instead, focus on building and returning
    a string that would be a suitable representation of the object's data.
</p>
<div class="hint">
  Use the toString method of the java.util.Arrays class to print each row in the array.
</div>
<div class="hint">
  After each row, include a newline character (\n) so that the remainder of the string will
    be placed on a new line.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    There are newline characters following the 1st and 2nd row but no newline character following the third row.
