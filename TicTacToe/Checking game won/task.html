<p>We will need a method to determine whether one of the players has won.</p>
<p>In the game of TicTacToe, there are a total of eight ways to win:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the top row</li>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the middle row</li>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the bottom row</li>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the left column</li>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the middle column</li>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the right column</li>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the left diagonal</li>
    <li>The same player occupies all spaces in the right diagonal</li>
</ul>
<p>Implement the checkWon method to determine whether the player provided as a
    parameter occupies all the necessary spaces for a win.</p>
<div class="hint">
  Eight cases need to be evaluated but if none of those cases is true, the player has not won.
