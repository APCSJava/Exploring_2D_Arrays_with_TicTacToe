<p>Notice the datatype associated with the board. We'll use integer types for this game. An
    empty square will be represented by 0 while squares taken
    by player 1 and 2 will be assigned values 1 and 2, respectively.
</p>
<p>Inside the constructor, initialize the field <code>board</code>
    to an array of the appropriate type having three rows and three columns.</p>
<div class="hint">
    As the number of columns and number of rows are always 3, you can hard code that value
    into your initialization code.
</div>
<div class="hint">
  Be sure to initialize the field 'board' and not a local variable of the same name.
